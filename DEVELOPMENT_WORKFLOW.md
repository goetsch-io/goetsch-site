## **2️⃣ GitHub Branching Strategy**
### **📌 Branches to Use**
- **Main Branches:**
  - **`main`** → Stable production-ready code.
  - **`develop`** → Integration branch where features are tested before merging into `main`.

- **Feature Branches:**
  - **`feature/frontend`** → UI development, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript.
  - **`feature/backend`** → API integrations, Hugo templates.
  - **`feature/security`** → Security improvements, audits.
  - **`feature/content`** → Blog updates, metadata, SEO.
  - **`feature/automation`** → CI/CD pipelines, deployment scripts.

- **Support Branches:**
  - **`hotfix/security`** → Urgent security fixes.
  - **`bugfix/`** → For fixing non-critical bugs.
  - **`test/`** → For experimenting with changes not related to a specific issue.

- **Release Branches:**
  - **`release/X.X.X`** → Versioned releases.

### **📌 Merge Process**
1. **Feature branches → `develop`** → Tested & reviewed.
2. **`develop` → `main`** → Only stable, production-ready code.
3. **Hotfixes** (critical issues) → Directly merged into `main`.

---

## **3️⃣ Development Workflow**
### **📌 Daily Workflow for Developers**
1. Pull the latest changes from `develop`.
2. Work on an assigned **feature branch**.
3. Commit changes with clear messages.
4. Push the feature branch and open a **Pull Request (PR)**.
5. Request a **code review** from a team member.
6. Merge into `develop` **only after approval & passing CI/CD tests**.
7. Deploy to **staging environment** (Netlify/Vercel preview).
8. After testing, merge `develop` → `main`.

### **📌 Deployment Strategy**
✅ Use **GitHub Actions** for automated builds.
✅ Host previews on **Netlify or Vercel**.
✅ **Final production site** deployed via **GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages**.

---

## **4️⃣ Automation & CI/CD Setup**
### **📌 GitHub Actions Configuration**
1. **Build & Test:** Automatically run `hugo build` on each PR.
2. **Lint & Format:** Enforce Tailwind and Hugo coding standards.
3. **Security Scans:** Run `npm audit`, `snyk test` for dependencies.
4. **Performance Checks:** Use Lighthouse CI for performance audits.
5. **Deployment:** Deploy previews to Netlify/Vercel for review.

---

## **5️⃣ Security & Compliance**
### **📌 Security Best Practices**
✅ Use **CSP & CORS headers** for protection.
✅ **Limit access** via GitHub branch protections.
✅ Scan for vulnerabilities using **Snyk & Dependabot**.
✅ Implement **HTTPS & strict security headers**.
✅ **Automate security testing** on each push.

---

## **6️⃣ Project Management & Collaboration**
### **📌 Tools to Use**
✅ **GitHub Issues & Projects** → Task tracking.
✅ **Slack/Teams** → Team communication.
✅ **Figma** → UI design collaboration.
✅ **Notion/Confluence** → Documentation.
✅ **Weekly Standups** → Sync meetings to track progress.

### **📌 Review & Approval Process**
1. Every PR must be reviewed by **at least one team member**.
2. All features are **tested in the staging environment** before merging into `main`.
3. Security reviews are required for `feature/security` and `hotfix/security` branches.
4. Performance testing must be completed for major UI changes.

---

## **7️⃣ Next Steps**
✅ **Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD**
✅ **Establish GitHub branch protections**
✅ **Onboard team members & assign tasks**
✅ **Start development using feature branches**
✅ **Deploy first preview & test workflows**
✅ **Iterate & refine the workflow as needed**

---

**By following this plan, we ensure a smooth development process, maintain security, and ship a fully functional Hugo-based static website. 🚀**
