## Hello, I'm Bradley Goetsch

Welcome to my personal website! This is a clean, minimal Hugo site.

### About Me

I'm passionate about technology and innovation. This space will showcase my projects, thoughts, and experiences.

### What's Next

This is just the beginning. I'll be adding more content and features to this site soon!

### Continuous Delivery

This site is now set up with a continuous delivery pipeline using GitHub Actions and Cloudflare Pages. Any changes pushed to the main branch will automatically be deployed.
