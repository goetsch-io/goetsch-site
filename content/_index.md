## Hello, I'm Bradley Goetsch

Welcome to my personal website! This is a clean, minimal Hugo site built with Tailwind CSS and deployed through Cloudflare Pages.

### About Me

I'm passionate about technology and innovation. This space will showcase my projects, thoughts, and experiences.

### What's Next

This is just the beginning. I'll be adding more content and features to this site soon!

### Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline

This site is deployed through a hybrid CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for testing and Cloudflare Pages for secure deployment. The current URL is https://goetsch-site.pages.dev/ but will eventually change to a custom domain.

The pipeline automatically:
- Builds and tests the site
- Runs security scans
- Deploys to Cloudflare Pages only after successful tests
