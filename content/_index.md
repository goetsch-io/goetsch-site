## Hello, I'm Bradley Goetsch

Welcome to my personal website! This is a clean, minimal Hugo site.

### About Me

I'm passionate about technology and innovation. This space will showcase my projects, thoughts, and experiences.

### What's Next

This is just the beginning. I'll be adding more content and features to this site soon!

### Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline

This site is now set up with an enhanced hybrid CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for testing and Cloudflare Pages Deploy Hooks for secure deployment. This approach provides better security, clearer separation of concerns, and simplified deployment.

The pipeline automatically:
- Builds and tests the site
- Runs security scans
- Deploys to Cloudflare Pages only after successful tests
