## My Personal Website

This website itself is one of my projects! Built with Hugo and styled with Tailwind CSS, it serves as both a portfolio and a blog.

### Technologies Used

- **Hugo**: A fast and flexible static site generator
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework
- **Markdown**: For content creation
- **GitHub**: For version control and deployment

### Features

- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Fast loading times thanks to static site generation
- Blog section for sharing thoughts and tutorials
- Projects showcase

### Development Workflow

This project features an optimized development workflow:

- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent Hugo server and Tailwind CSS watching
- **Automated Browser Opening**: Commands that automatically open the browser
- **Deployment Automation**: Simple deploy commands with status tracking
- **CSS Auto-Rebuilding**: CSS rebuilds automatically when files change
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all commands

### Future Plans

I plan to continue improving this site by adding:

- Dark mode toggle
- Search functionality
- Comments section for blog posts
- More interactive elements
