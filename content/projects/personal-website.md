## My Personal Website

This website itself is one of my projects! Built with Hugo and styled with Tailwind CSS, it serves as both a portfolio and a blog.

### Technologies Used

- **Hugo**: A fast and flexible static site generator
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework
- **Markdown**: For content creation
- **GitHub**: For version control and deployment

### Features

- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Fast loading times thanks to static site generation
- Blog section for sharing thoughts and tutorials
- Projects showcase

### Future Plans

I plan to continue improving this site by adding:

- Dark mode toggle
- Search functionality
- Comments section for blog posts
- More interactive elements
